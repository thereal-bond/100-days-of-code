# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017

Alright #100DaysOfCode, I know it starts tomorrow, but since Javascript arrays are 0-based, today is my #day0.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) Began Basic algorithm challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:**

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) FCC

**Thoughts:** Wrote an algorithm to capitalize the first letter of every word in a string, and studied event-driven programming.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) FCC

**Thoughts:** I'm very close to writing my first algorithm with no outside help. FCC truncate a string. Need to step away for a bit and try again.
Update to my algorithm. I needed help. It's okay, for once I actually understood why I was doing what I was doing. Progress.
AND I finished the Foundations of Programming Course on Lynda. I think before I do anything else I'm going to start going through CS50. I haven't decided if I'm just going to watch the youtube videos or if I'll do the Psets as well or even more. There's a lot of content to cover. And it's mostly a passive way of learning so I may not want to dive that deep. Or maybe I'll work through some codeacademy problems while I'm making my way through, with FCC sprinkled in. There's only so much you can do on algorithms in one day with any hope of retention of knowledge...
