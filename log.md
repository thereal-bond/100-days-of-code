# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017

Alright #100DaysOfCode, I know it starts tomorrow, but since Javascript arrays are 0-based, today is my #day0.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) Began Basic algorithm challenges on FCC

**Thoughts:**

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) FCC

**Thoughts:** working palindrome algorithm problem while my 1 yr old eats breakfast. Daniel Tiger = bckgrnd tunes

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) FCC

**Thoughts:** Wrote an algorithm to capitalize the first letter of every word in a string, and studied event-driven programming.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) FCC

**Thoughts:** debugging.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) FCC

**Thoughts:** Learning about Object Orientation and working on an algorithm to check if a given string ends with another string

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) FCC

**Thoughts:** I'm very close to writing my first algorithm with no outside help. FCC truncate a string. Need to step away for a bit and try again.
Update to my algorithm. I needed help. It's okay, for once I actually understood why I was doing what I was doing. Progress.
AND I finished the Foundations of Programming Course on Lynda. I think before I do anything else I'm going to start going through CS50. I haven't decided if I'm just going to watch the youtube videos or if I'll do the Psets as well or even more. There's a lot of content to cover. And it's mostly a passive way of learning so I may not want to dive that deep. Or maybe I'll work through some codeacademy problems while I'm making my way through, with FCC sprinkled in. There's only so much you can do on algorithms in one day with any hope of retention of knowledge...

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CodeNewbie, CS50 videos, and Javascript and JQuery by Jon Duckett

**Thoughts:** Very busy day - passive learning day

**Link to work:** 

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lots of FCC including Chunky Monkey and CS50 vids

**Thoughts:**  Slasher algorithm got me - deceptively simple. I was trying to build these elaborate functions and it just needed a line of code. Good reminder.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Seek & Destroy Algorithm, CS50 Vids, considering starting the lynda git course soon...

**Thoughts:** I continue to need outside help with the algorithms. But they're making more sense as to why they go together.

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC JSON

**Thoughts:** I'm doing these JSON exercises but I don't feel I'm learning anywhere near what I should. The FCC exercises provide so little context - if I'm going to really learn JSON I'm going to have to hit some outside resources. But I'm not interested in doing that just yet. I want to become more masterful in javascript, CSS, and HTML before I start trying to dive too deep into a tangent.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CodeNewbie, exploring learning options

**Thoughts:** I'm at a weekend-long quilt retreat (much-needed - I'm a working mom and this is a once a year thing for me). So I'm focused on recharging. But I'm listening to lots of CodeNewbie and keeping my brain in the game. I also looked into hackerrank and exercism.io

### Day 12: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CodeNewbie

**Thoughts:** Close to a skip day. But so much CodeNewbie I'm counting it.

### Day 13: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC JSON 

**Thoughts:** See Day 10 notes. I'm doing these exercises but I'm not going to retain it and I know that. If I want to utilize jQuery I'm going to need some outside resources.

### Day 14: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Random Quotes Generator

**Thoughts:** Started building random quotes project-Decided to use array and keep it simple..for now. Maybe an API later? I decided to make the quotes "Zen" themed since I already keep a collection of those and had them available at hand.

### Day 15: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Random Quotes Generator

**Thoughts:** The quote machine works! Now I'm refreshing myself on CSS to make it look pretty. I remember nothing...

### Day 16: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Random Quotes Generator

**Thoughts:** Still working on quote machine. I used a template from w3schools for the CSS and it looks much better. I would like to tweak the look of the button some more. I also still need to add the twitter button option. Those are the must-dos. Nice-to-dos would be to change the quotes from text to images, and change the background color with a nice fade whenever the quote changes. Also somehow to tweak the algorithm so the same quote can't be chosen twice. Not right now but someday would be to tweak the whole back end so that instead of drawing from an array it's drawing from an API.
