# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Foundations of Programming Course (lynda.com) Chapter 6 (Iteration) and Chapter 7 (More about Strings)
                      Freecodecamp 4 Exercises in Basic Javascript

**Thoughts:** I really like the Lynda class I'm taking. The teacher is clear and helpful. Freecodecamp's exercises were tough today - they weren't as aligned with what I've been learning on lynda as they have been and so I feel like I'm multitasking a bit. I struggled with the "Counting Cards" exercise because I legit didn't realize that I could put two return statements in the same function. I thought the program would end and that would be that. D'oh!
